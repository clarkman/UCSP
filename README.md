# UCSP (Ultra Cool Signal Processing)
Matlab code for signal processing

This code is distributed with absolutely no guarantees of accuracy or correctness at all. Think: my scratchpad pushed to git for better availability, and for making friends. Use at your own risk.

This code base has evolved over many years of Matlab abuse, including high automation as of late, such as driving test equipment in a UL or other lab, and producing plots on the spot to support testing and troubleshooting.

There are several project directions at the moment:

1. Complete push of all remaining pieces, @quat, circ, others
1. Winnow out truft
1. Adapt to Octave (trickiest part areÂ DSP matlab objects)
1. Pluralize mex Makefiles to speak Octave
1. Merge in UCSP (Ultra Cool Signal Processing) C++ project

Progress will be sporadic

THANK YOU!
